This is a Android SDL project for building Spearmint (a modified ioquake3 engine).

Currently this might not be working. SDL2 doesn't seem to work on my Android device (Droid) and the apk created here seems to fail in the emulator.

Requires Android SDK and Android NDK r8d.

To build Spearmint for Android do the following;

Symlink or hg clone SDL2 into jni/SDL
Symlink or git clone spearmint's android branch into jni/spearmint

Create jni/spearmint/Makefile.local with the following:
ANDROID_NDK_DIR=/path/to/android-ndk-r8d

SDL MIPS compile fix:
Add "#define HAVE_GCC_ATOMICS	1" in jni/SDL/include/SDL_config_android.h
	(After this has been verified that it is okay, it should be submitted upstream...)

Run the following:
make -C jni/spearmint COMPILE_PLATFORM=android COMPILE_ARCH=armeabi
make -C jni/spearmint COMPILE_PLATFORM=android COMPILE_ARCH=armeabi-v7a
make -C jni/spearmint COMPILE_PLATFORM=android COMPILE_ARCH=x86
make -C jni/spearmint COMPILE_PLATFORM=android COMPILE_ARCH=mips

	(If you don't want to build all of them edit jni/Application.mk)

Run Android NDK r86 ndk-build, i.e. /path/to/android-ndk-r8d/ndk-build

Run 'ant debug'

Now you should have bin/SpearmintActivity-debug.apk which can be installed and tested.
